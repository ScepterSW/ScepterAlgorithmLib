## AI-Camera's Algorithm Library

This directory stores algorithm libraries based on MorphAISDK. 

### Software architecture

<img src="assets/architecture.png" alt="architecture" style="zoom:80%;" />

The algorithm library runs on the camera and interacts with other modules through the C/C++ Interface of [MorphAISDK](https://github.com/ScepterSW/MorphAISDK). Only algorithms based on deep learning have NPU models.

### Directory Structure

To be released.
